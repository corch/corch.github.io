Security nerd. Privacy warrior. Actual ninja. 

This corner of the Internet is where put my (barely filtered) thoughts into written words. *Fair warning:* if you read them you may find them highly entertaining, or highly offensive. Possibly both. Proceed at your own risk.

If you're wondering, the X has no amusing or mystical meaning, it is literally just filler. Web apps and databases just don't like mononyms.
